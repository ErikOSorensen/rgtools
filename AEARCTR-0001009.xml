  <abstract>"Overall student learning levels remain low across East Africa, despite a decade plus of major reforms and significant new investments in public education. In recent years, teacher performance pay has received an increasing amount attention as a means of improving student learning. Yet the current evidence on teacher performance pay is at best mixed, with some studies finding large positive effects, and others finding little or no effects at all. However, these studies are not directly comparable as they are performed in different contexts, with different incentive structures, and different budgets.  In the KiuFunza II RCT we evaluate two different teacher incentive programs implemented in 180 randomly selected government primary schools across ten districts in Tanzania, focusing on English, Kiswahili, and Math in Grades 1, 2, and 3. In the first arm, “levels”, teachers are paid a bonus based on the number of skills within a given subject a student is able to master. In the second arm, “gains”, students are placed in ability groups at the beginning of the year based on starting test scores. Teachers are then rewarded for their students’ improvements within their specific ability groups, regardless of initial learning levels. The goal of the RCT is to determine whether there is clear evidence that teacher incentive schemes and pay for performance programs are effective at improving learning outcomes."</abstract>

      <description>Students will be tested at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year. Grade 1 students will be tested at the beginning of the first and second years, to provide baseline scores to evaluate their initial learning levels. For some analysis we will also aggregate test scores across subjects by summing them and the re-normalizing (dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group).</description>
