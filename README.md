# rgtools

Repository with the tooling for capturing data from social science registry trials.

To begin with, there are two main tools: 

1. `rg-schema.xsd` which defines an xml schema to represent data captured from registrations and pre-analysis plans.
2. `AEAtrials.py` which has the beginnings of a small library to read and process the Social Science Registry data. As of now, it can read take a trial number as argument and print out an xml-template with some of the auto filled-in information from the registry.
